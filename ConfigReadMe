To make pico connect to Network run by you, 
Go to main.c and edit ssid, pass and mode as required. 
ssid = SSID Of Network
pass = Password to connect to network
mode = Authentication Of Network (Open/WPA/WPA2AES)
Might need to restart pico once or twice as does not always connect successfully.

To Enable dns spoofing, Run Program once and record down IP Address of picoW Web Server.
Edit dnsserver.c to always return that IP to dns queries.

e.g. if 192.168.43.208 is the IP address of the picoW, edit the following lines in dnsserver.c as shown below. 
    *answer_ptr++ = 192; // Set the desired IP address
    *answer_ptr++ = 168;
    *answer_ptr++ = 43;
    *answer_ptr++ = 208;

To choose SSID to spoof, go to <ip address of picoW>/ssid.cgi?ssid=config.
After chosen, Button 20 needs to be pressed on PicoMaker to start the spoofing!
