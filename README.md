# INF2004 - Embedded Systems Project
**I. Introduction**

In the realm of wireless network security, the Raspberry Pi Pico emerges as a versatile tool capable of both offensive and defensive operations. This project delves into the intricacies of utilizing the Pico Pi to conduct an attack and defend wireless networks. With a primary focus on impersonating public Wi-Fi networks, the tool aims to allow users to connect unwittingly, providing an avenue to acquire credentials. Simultaneously, the Pico serves as a portable, efficient, and cost-effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Tailored for establishments such as cafes and restaurants, the project presents a solution that not only facilitates Wi-Fi provision but also safeguards against potential threats. 

**II. Key Features**

- Wifi Scanning
- Spoofing WiFi to an Access Point (AP)
- DNS Spoofing
- Social Engineer the Google Page 
- Save Data to a SD Card (E.g. )

**III. Objectives**

Our main goal was to successfully capture the client's credentials when logging in to our WiFi connection page. 

**IV. Overview of Program (Modular Design)**



**V. Requirements to Run**



**VI. How to run the program?**

Steps:
1. Connect to Pico WH
2. Scan for nearby WiFi
3. Spoofed one of the scanned WiFi and act as an AP
4. It will then lead to the WiFi Login page
5. User will then choose to login via Gmail account
6. The login credentials will then be stored in the SD Card
