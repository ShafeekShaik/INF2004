# INF2004 - Embedded Systems Project
**I. Introduction**

In the realm of wireless network security, the Raspberry Pi Pico emerges as a versatile tool capable of both offensive and defensive operations. This project delves into the intricacies of utilizing the Pico Pi to conduct an attack and defend wireless networks. With a primary focus on impersonating public Wi-Fi networks, the tool aims to allow users to connect unwittingly, providing an avenue to acquire credentials. Simultaneously, the Pico serves as a portable, efficient, and cost-effective Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Tailored for establishments such as cafes and restaurants, the project presents a solution that not only facilitates Wi-Fi provision but also safeguards against potential threats.
